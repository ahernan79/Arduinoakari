All my Arduino engineering assignments

## Not So Basic Arduino
These were the assignments I did at the beginning of the 2019-2020 school year, before the ultrasonic robot.
Assignments: Hello Functions, Hello World, New Ping, WLED

### Hello Functions
Function: Uses returning value from an ultrasonic sensor to move a servo an amount based on distance returned by sensor. Prints distance to serial monitor.
What I learned: How to code an ultrasonic sensor as well as improving my skills making one function occur based on the returns of another(this came in handy doing projects like potentiometers later).
Challenges: I struggled with servo movement a little but fixing my math splitting the value return into degrees of movement fixed the problem.

### Hello World
Function: Printed "Hello World" to LCD screen.
What I learned: How to code and wire an LCD to a breadboard.
Challenges: I struggled getting the wiring correct at first
